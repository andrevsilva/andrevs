I started early when I was 13 years old in the computing area, where at the age of 15 I already had more than 10 clients from different areas in Rio de Janeiro. At the age of 18 I entered college where I did a little Mechatronics Engineering and shortly after I moved to the CPOR-RJ (Reserve Officers Preparation Center) in the Brazilian army and thus starting a brief military career working in the area of ​​technology. and taking courses related to the area, where I was responsible for the health of the barracks servers, information security services, a little programming and data integrity. During my time in the military I took several courses such as military technologies, intelligence and counterintelligence actions, servers and military programming. At the end of my period as a military officer I left there as 2nd Lieutenant of Communications and from there I decided to embrace the codes even more and specialize as a Front-end Developer where I currently have more than 5 years in the market working with various technologies such and always keeping me in constant study and learning the best technologies and practices of today. I live as a technology enthusiast, always looking for new challenges and going after my dream, which is to use technology to transform everyone's lives, save people and change the world for the better, not being a hero but a developer.",
