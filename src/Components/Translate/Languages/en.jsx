        text: 'Born and raised in Rio de Janeiro, I’m a 30-year-old technology enthusiast with a passion for innovation. I started early, at age 13, working in computing, and by 15 I was already supporting over 10 clients, handling software, hardware, and network responsibilities. At 18, I began a degree in Mechatronics Engineering and was later selected to join the CPOR-RJ (Preparatory Center for Army Reserve Officers) of the Brazilian Army, where I had a brief military career focused on technology. During my time in the Army, I worked in areas such as infrastructure, server administration, information security, and internal system development. I completed specialized courses in military technology, intelligence and counterintelligence, and programming for mission-critical systems. I was responsible for data integrity, server health, and the security of internal military systems. At the end of my service, I left the Army as a Second Lieutenant in Communications and decided to fully dedicate myself to Front-end development. Today, I have 9 years of experience as a Front-end Developer, working on large-scale, high-complexity projects in both public and private sectors. I specialize in modern web technologies and constantly seek out the best tools and practices in the industry. I’m passionate about technology, driven by challenges, and guided by a purpose: to use code to create real impact, transform lives, and build a better world — not as a hero, but as a developer who believes in the power of technology.',

I translated Figma layouts into functional interfaces, focusing on responsiveness and visual accuracy. I used HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap for responsive design, JavaScript (with Fetch) for API consumption and back-end integration with Delphi, and jQuery for microinteractions and animations. The database used was MySQL. I introduced the concept of version control to the team, led internal training sessions on Git, and drove the adoption of Git as the company’s official versioning tool",

The application supports multiple user profiles, including buyers, sellers, agents, back-office teams, and managers, using agile methodologies such as Scrum and Kanban, supported by tools like Jira, Slack, and Trello. I used Adobe XD to analyze wireframes and layouts, which were translated into responsive, production-ready code. Miro was used for sprint planning in a remote work setup. I actively participated in meetings with UI, UX, and content teams to align deliverables. I developed features such as visit scheduling, user registration, negotiations, chat modules, document management, property editing, a multi-user dashboard with role-based access, and automatic email triggers based on user actions. The initial tech stack included HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, PHP, and CodeIgniter. Later, ReactJS was integrated into the project, using Axios for API consumption, Formik and Yup for form handling, and Reactstrap and Styled Components for component styling. Code versioning was managed with Git and Bitbucket, and the database used was MySQL. APIs were consumed using Fetch (JavaScript) and Axios (React).',
